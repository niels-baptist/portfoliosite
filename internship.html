                    <p>Between the 28th of February and the 27th of May, I worked as an intern at VRT for 3 months in the Data & Intelligence unit. Working with
                        Sporza en VRT NWS article data, I was given the opportunity to research the article lifecycle and the parameters that affect it.
                        I worked in a team of 12 data experts, consisting of data engineers and data scientists, with the larger part of the team being external consultants.
                        My main tasks were to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Develop a machine learning model that predicts the article lifecycle of an article that is about to be published</li>
                            <li>Make a dashboard containing the key insights of the parameters that affect the article lifecycle and the pagaviews</li>
                        </ul>
                        I used Amazon Web Services its Sagemaker Notebooks to make the notebooks that I needed to manipulte the data and eventually to make the model. After
                        the model was finished, I made a flask web application in which you can input some parameters, that returns you a prediction. <br>
                        To visualise my findings, I used a CSV export of that data and used a local instance of Microsoft Power BI. <br>
                        Below I provided a screenshot of the dashboard that I made, as well as a GIF of the web application doing its thing.

                    <p>As a fan of sports and media, VRT has always been a part of our living room at home, whether its 
                        watching the news or a football game. I am a huge fan of the Sporza and VRT NWS mobile and web applications
                        and have used them on a daily basis for quite while already. Furthermore, I really looked for a large company
                        to do my internship at, because I did not have any experience working in one and believed it would be a great
                        learning experience. Working in a large company like VRT in the capitol of our country, two significant new 
                        experiences for me, which in hindsight, were really great.

                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>Every month, the journalists of both Sporza and VRT NWS publish thousands of articles. These articles
                        differ from each other greatly in many ways. For example, the articles are not always about the same topic,
                        they can be about sports, entertainment, politics, or even about the weather. The articles are also not always
                        written by the same journalist, and the length of the articles can be greatly different. It would be useful 
                        therefore; if we had a way of knowing what kind of pageviews and lifecycle we would get from the articles; 
                        before we published them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The moment a journalist is publishing an article, it is useful to know how the article will perform,
                        so that both the recommendation engine has extra input to work with as a reference, and the journalist
                        can make the most of the article concerning updates & follow-up. They will for example invest more time in
                        providing updates for an article with a very high expected number of views. And they could for example decide to
                        include or not include a video in the article depending on the predictions made before publishing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The redaction teams at VRT NWS and Sporza also have control over the contents of the home page, and it is possible that
                        if they feel that the homepage layout decisions will be influenced by the number of expected pageviews and duration
                        of people reading it. It could therefore be useful to have a way of knowing what articles will be performing like, so
                        that they have an extra metric of deciding what to include or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There has not been much research into the influencers of pageviews and the article lifecycle yet, and the people working
                        with this data are geniunly curious as to what things impact views and lifecycles of articles in what ways. It is therefore
                        a plus if they can get more insight into this data, because the things they learn from it can be applied to various
                        future projects which lean in the direction of improving the user experience and recommending the right articles at the right time.

                    <p>There are 2 main aspects of the technical assignment: One is focused around analytics and 
                        <span class="text-green">Business Intelligence</span>,
                        the main goal here is to start from raw data and manufacture it into a format that allows me to create
                        visualisations and dashboards which can be used to share valuable insights to the business.
                        The other aspect of this assignment is focused around <span class="text-green">Data Science</span>, 
                        where I will use the analytical data
                        as a basis for creating training data that will allow me to create machine learning models. These models will
                        be used to predict the expected performance of articles. With performance in thiss case, I mean the number of pageviews
                        that an article is expected to get, and the time it will take to reach a number of views. My colleagues and I decided to choose
                        the point where 90% of pageviews have been reached as the end of our lifecycle, so the time between publishing and
                        reaching this point (expressed in hours) is what the machine learning model is going to predict. 
                    </p>
                    <p>In short, my technical assignment goes as follows:</p>

                            <li>Manipulate data and join the right columns to get useful data</li>

                <p>As with any project, we want to keep a timeline of what we're going to do. I made this planning to keep track of my progress and
                to visualise when I decided to take on certain aspects of the project. There are 2 important things to note when looking at my
                project planning: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I was generous when deciding how long it would take me to get settled completely

                            <li><span class="text-green">Reasoning</span>: Since I am working with completely new data, in a team that is new to me,
                            I figured it would be beneficial not to rush the start and get on one page with everyone on what my best strategy would be.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The last column of my planning spans longer than the other ones

                            <li><span class="text-green">Reasoning</span>: As you first start on a project, it is difficult to predict the way in
                            which things will work out months later. So I decided to not go into too much detail about the last few weeks few weeks
                            of my internship, and rather make one that allows for more flexibility.

                    <p>For a good internship, it is necessary to maintain good communication with the team you are working in, so I am lucky to be involved in the daily stand-up meetings. In this unit, we work with Jira using kanban, which gives more flexibility in terms of timing compared to the traditional scrum methodology.
                        Apart from these daily stand-up meetings, there are weekly alignment meetings on Monday between the different profiles within the team. On Thursday, there is a knowledge sharing meeting between the people of data science and on Wednesday, the planning of the data science profiles is reviewed. In this way, myself and the rest of the team are always well informed of each other.
                        To keep my supervisor informed of my progress at the internship, I will e-mail a weekly report to both my internship mentor at Thomas More and my internship supervisor at VRT. In this I place an overview of what I worked on last week, supplemented by a paragraph in which I express myself about my experiences at my internship.

                        After my internship finishes, I won't be there to explain my findings to the team. That's why I made sure that the work i did is well documented and the right people have access to it. I made a <a class="bold" href="">technical internship report</a> (14 pages), containing the semantic explanation
                        of my reasoning while writing my code solution. I made sure to keep good track of my files in a well-structured <a href="https://github.com/niels-baptist/VRT_internship">Github repository</a>, containing different subfolders and different Readme files for each of the 4 'subtask' of the project I have worked on. Inside of this repo I made sure to link 
                        my documents as well.

                    <p>A large part of my internship consisted of data analysis. To present my findings to the staff of the VRT NWS and Sporza editors, I built a Power BI dashboard with the most important insights, so that I could process these visualisations in a PowerPoint presentation. </p>
                    <p>The data I needed to create my visualisations was pulled in from Amazon S3, and then heavily transformed in Jupyter notebooks on Amazon Sagemaker before loading it into power BI. Some of the main edits I made: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Classes: Different categories added according to percentile values for key columns</li>
                        <li>Total & achieved pageviews: Performed calculations to determine the total and current (cumulative sum) number of readers reached for articles. To do this, I merged the article data provided to me with the corresponding Adobe Experience Manager data that monitors readers. </li>
                        <li>Hours until 90% pageviews: Cutoff percentage set to call an article 'mature' (=90% of all reads achieved), calculations made to express in hours for each article how long it takes to get to this point.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Below is image of the first tab of the dashboard:</p>

                    <p>To obtain the right data to use for predictions, I use the same notebook as for the data pre-processing in the Business Intelligence section, with the difference that I do label encoding and logarithmic scaling. Label encoding ensures that all categorical values are converted to numerical labels, while logarithmic scaling ensures that the very large and very small views are pushed closer together.</p>

                    <p>After the training data was made ready to work with, I started looking at the different possibilities to make predictions. After a lot of experimentation, I decided to work with a Gradient Boosting Regressor from Scikit-Learn. I hereby split my data into a training and test with an 80/20 split before I start. When training my models, I use Grid Search with cross-validation from Scikit-Learn to get the ideal set of parameters for my training.
                        In total, I train both for VRT NWS and Sporza each 2 models in the same way, with 1 small difference: the first model 'model_total', I train with as input all the training values except the pageviews. The second model 'model_90', I train with the same input values, plus the column 'pageviews_total', which contains the total achieved pageviews of the article. 
                        The reason why I approach it this way has to do with the way I work to make predictions. The idea is that an editor uses the model before the article is published to get a better overview of how the article will behave after it is published. It is therefore important that no data can be entered for the predictions in connection with the viewing figures, because we do not know these at the moment. The first model will therefore take the supplied article data and make a prediction of the expected total ratings. The second model will then use the same data, supplemented with the expected total ratings, to make a prediction of the expected lifetime of an article, expressed in the number of hours it will take to reach 90% of the total ratings</p>

                <div class="col-12">
                    <p>The final goal that my internship assignment should serve is to deliver a model that can make predictions about the expected pageviews. The strategy used by me to achieve this is as follows: through a web application, an editor enters the parameters of an article on a form (title length, presence of video, Article type, etc). The trained model then gives a guess of how many views it thinks the article will achieve. Immediately after that, it uses that prediction to make a guess of how long it would take to reach that number of views, expressed in hours, it then gives this back to the user, who is presented with it on a nice web page.
                        I personally chose to add this last step to the process, because it turns the abstract idea of a Jupyter Notebook into a practical example that is much more relevant and demonstrative to show to the average end user.</p>

                    <p>During this three-month internship, I learned a lot of new things, both on a technical and non-technical level. This was the first time that I was part of a large company (2143 employees), where different departments exist, each with their own priorities and specialisations. It was innovative to see what an IT department looks like and works in a company that does so much more than just IT, where there is an interaction between what the editorial team expects from the data team and vice-versa. Some of the technologies I first came into contact with during my internship:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sagemaker</li>
                            <li>S3</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Pyspark</li>
                        <li>Seaborn</li>
                        <li>Named Entity Recognition</li>
                        <li>Laten Dirichlet allocation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some of the challenges I personally faced:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Work in an orderly fashion: it's easy to lose track of what you're doing when you have dozens of operations in different notebooks for multiple purposes.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span class="text-green"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i> Solution</span>: I made sure to keep my notebooks orered in seperate folders with clear names and a number describing the order in which the 
                                notebook is supposed to be executed when going throught the data flow.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>
                            Theoretical understanding: when discussing a specific algorithm or data-manipulation technique, I often noticed that, as a professional bachelor student, I could not quite follow what the colleagues (who often have an academic bachelor's degree as well as experience) exactly meant.
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="text-green"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i> Solution</span>: I spent a bunch of time researching the the theory behind certain algorhytms and consulted my colleagues if I needed help understanding something.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the team I was allowed to work in, Data & Intelligence, more specifically the Data Platform, I was well surrounded by a collection of external consultants (Brainjar, Datashift, Dataroots) and internal staff (VRT). I participated in daily stand-up meetings, weekly Data Science knowledge-sharing sessions and alignment meetings. Monthly, I was part of the Data & Intelligence (D&I) meeting and participated in the team retrospective. I participated in team building activities (football) and departmental keynotes. Whenever I had questions or needed advice, I could always reach out to my colleagues who were happy to help me and push me in the right direction. My colleagues were interested in the internship assignment and regularly asked of their own accord how things were going.
                        In addition, I chose an internship in the capital, my first interaction with a big city. Even though most days, 3 to 4 per week, were spent working from home, I spent some time gazing at the busy streets while riding my folding bike through Schaarbeek. Apart from my internship hours, I also took the time to soak up the atmosphere and see the local sights. 
                        I can look back on this internship with a positive feeling and say that I have learned a lot, both on a technical and on a personal level. This experience in the field has only confirmed and even strengthened my certainty of choosing the world of data. I would also like to thank everyone who has guided me and welcomed me, and whom I could count on whenever I had a problem.</p>
